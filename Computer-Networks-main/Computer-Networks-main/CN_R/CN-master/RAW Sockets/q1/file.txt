Assume that a process S in a server system is providing a connection-oriented service as follows: a client process C,
connects to the sever process S, and sends a message containing: an IP address (IP5), and a file name (f1).  That means
 the client process is requesting the server process to send contents of the specified file (f1 is in server computer system)
 to processes which are in the computer system whose IP address is IP5. Now the server process makes arrangements and execs S2.
 exe without command line arguments.
 S2.c code is as below.
main()
{ char buf[50];
         while  !eof(stdin) {
          cin >>  buf ;
          cout << buf ; }
}
Write programs for all processes.

Consider the following figure. A Client Process sends an enquiry message to Server computer system, asking for what
are all the service server processes available in it. All the service server processes will receive this message and
each one of them replies to the client about its service information (All of them may not send replies at the same time).
 The client now connects to the required service sever process. A client can connect to multiple server processes. Write code for all processes.
